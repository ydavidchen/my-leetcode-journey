# LeetCode Challenge Problems for Leisure

David Chen, Ph.D.

## Overview

Still following #stayhome #workremotely orders with a bit more free time than I would've imaged, I decided to commit to daily LeetCode challenge for one month straight. 

## Directory Structure

My _accepted responses_ for each week are included in their respective folders.

The code here are all executed within LeetCode's engine, and copied into a file with either .py, .cpp, or .java extension.

Only solutions that passed the test or were excepted are included in this suppository.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to LeetCode for making (most of) the coding challenges publicly accessible without having to premium-subscribe.

**Disclaimer** Please note, the original problems (not included in the repository) here belong to LeetCode. I worked on these problems for the sole purpose of leisure, and do not represent the views of any one. I frequently consult websites including LeetCode discussions, official solutions if available Wikipedia, Geek4Geek, StackOverflow to construct my solutions. Use any materials you find responsibly.
