# October 2020 LeetCode Challenge

David Chen, PhD

## Overview

Still following #stayhome #workremotely orders with a bit more free time than I would've imaged, I decided to commit to daily LeetCode challenge for one month straight. 

## Directory Structure

My _accepted responses_ for each week are included in their respective folders.

The code here are all executed within LeetCode's engine, and copied into a file with either .py, .cpp, or .java extension.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to LeetCode for making (most of) the coding challenges publicly accessible without having to premium-subscribe.

**Disclaimer** Please note, the original problems (not included in the repository) here belong to LeetCode. The repository would remain private until the challenge is finished, and could revert to private or be deleted any time upon request. I worked on these problems for the sole purpose of leisure, and do not represent the views of myself, my associations, employers, or friends and colleagues. I frequently consult websites including Wikipedia, Geek4Geek, StackOverflow to construct my solutions. Use any materials you find responsibly.
